    "\n",
    "- Write the `evolve()` method that:\n",
    "    - Takes as a parameter a string representing the name of the evolved Pokémon.\n",
    "    - If the current level of the Pokémon is strictly greater than its `evolution_level`, evolve it by changing the species name.\n",
    "    - In any case, returns `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write the `attacking()` method that:\n",
    "    - Takes as a parameter another Pokémon to attack (`other`): the \"defending\" Pokémon.\n",
    "    - Decreases the health of the attacked Pokémon by a value equal to (attacker's attack - defending's defense). NB: it is, therefore, possible that this leads to an increase in the health of the defending Pokémon, in the case that the calculated value is negative.\n",
    "    - In any case, it returns `other`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write the `potion()` method that cures the Pokémon, that is:\n",
    "    - If the health of the Pokémon is negative, resets it to 0.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, it increases it by 15.\n",
